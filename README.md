# Rat On a Scooter

Mr Rat is riding his vespa through the alleyways of New York City. On his way home, he encounters endless spiders and slimeballs that try to veer him off his path. Keep Mr Rat on track as long as you can! And AVOID THE SPIDERS AND SLIMEBALLS!!!! (and make sure to pick up some snacks on the way:))
